The 1st OASIS Hackathon Organizing Team

The OASIS Hackathon was jointly organized by universities in the Gwangju Honam region of South Korea, including Jeonnam National University, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Chosun University, and Kyungnam University. As a member of the GIST organizing team, I participated in the hackathon and was responsible for overall operation and promotion.

Specifically, I served as a member of the OASIS Hackathon TF (Public Relations Team) from October 2020 to February 2022, where I took charge of promoting the event and ensuring its smooth operation. Overall, our team worked tirelessly to make the OASIS Hackathon a success and help promote innovation and collaboration in the tech community.
